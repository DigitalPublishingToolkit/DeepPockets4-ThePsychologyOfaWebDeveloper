# The web developer

Meet Scott, Larry’s ‘boss’. To understand what makes Scott the kind of
web developer he is today, it’s important to understand his context.

When Scott decided to build his own CMS software, the internet was in a
state of transformation (namely, the early 2000s). This was the era in
which every printed publication decided to build a digital counterpart.
The era in which users started feeling restless in their reading mode,
in their ways of getting informed. The era in which new experiments in
graphic design were not impactful enough for the users to feel
connected, because the users longed for their own voices to be echoed
back to them during their consumption of digital spaces. It marked the
rise of social media platforms; this rise in turn marked the enforcement
of preserving the traditional web formats.

Back then, Scott was smart enough to sense where one particular group of
internet thinkers was going: to build accessible products now, and
charge for interactions later. This strong impression led Scott to
embrace a change users didn’t necessarily *want* to see in the world,
and to become part of building it anyway.

In the midst of this personal as well as worldwide transformation, Scott
knew exactly what to do: acquire all talents needed for a properly
organized system; a content management system. An urgent, still to be
defined plan erupted in his mind. This is approximately what Scott’s
plan looked like:

<u>Step one: Understanding the machine[^07thewebdeveloper_1]</u>

The first three years are the most important ones, during which I am to
shape the foundation of my practice. To gain a better understanding of
the machine, I shall not take myself too seriously.

I shall remember that it’s important to have fun coding and that
overconfidence may lead to blind self-destruction. At times, when I feel
smarter than the machine, I shall pull myself out of the expert’s skin,
for the machine would take advantage of the consequential confidence,

and crash *me*.

I shall not feel smarter than the machine.

Our relationship shall feel like research to me: a testing ground where
I’ll meet the programming language I wish to become fluent in, ‘the
frameworks’ I will of course want to master. In the first three years of
my quest, I shall continue my research in the hours available to me
after those spent on commissioned work.

In the third year, I shall settle for my techne-pack: my favourite
programming language, my favourite tools, my favourite technologies, my
favourite commands.

<u>Step two: Becoming the machine</u>

I shall enter the fourth year of my life as a coder with skills
sufficient enough to build a product, and an imagination wild enough to
visualize said product. I shall build my own Content Management System.
I will let the product’s functionalities list themselves in my mental
to-do list; I will let the design shine through my gut naturally and
become alive before my eyes; projected on my big screen.

Despite the ongoing sounds of the machine’s gibberish, I shall not get
mad anymore.

I want my clients to say *yes* to my product already halfway through the
product’s build-up. Let them come to me once they’ve decided to finally
dissociate themselves from WordPress.

<u>Step three: Beating the machine</u>

It is now the seventh year of my life as a coder. I understand
absolutely every syllable of gibberish the machine utters and when I
don’t, I am able to give it commands to switch to *my* language.

My product is ready to be launched and my clients are waiting in line.

No client’s demands, complaints, or deadlines, shall make me build in
WordPress, ever again. Between my product and my client, I shall
always—*always* choose my product.

The Client agrees to the terms and conditions set forth above as
demonstrated by their signature as follows:

Name:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Date:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Location:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Signature:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

<u>All other steps: A Stoic Man</u>[^07thewebdeveloper_2]

After ten years of my life as a coder, I shall start charging for all
unpaid hours spent on building the software after hours. My clients will
not doubt my expertise and will pay as much as I myself charge for doing
the work my software disables them to do.

I will cause the problem, and once they recognize it, will offer my
solutions.

Since most of this kind of web-maintaining work will be debugging and
documentation work, which I will not want to do, I shall get an
assistant.[^07thewebdeveloper_3] A freelancer who is willing to learn really fast.

Oh, and, I shall not get mad. *At all.* Not at my product, the machine’s
gibberish, and especially not at my partner. That’s not what stoic men
do.

Thus ends the vague-not-so-vague plan Scott has made for himself.
Without further ado, he decided to change his company name by adding
*Studio* in front of his name. Now all he needed was to get a new
address where he could be all by himself, install a server, and welcome
Larry. As he was seeking for a way to never lose sight of his dense,
mental forest, this long-term commitment seemed to be exactly what Scott
needed.

[^07thewebdeveloper_1]: ‘How truly sad it is that just at the very moment when the
    computer has something important to tell us, it starts speaking
    gibberish.’ — Gerald Weinberg, *The Psychology of Computer
    Programming*

[^07thewebdeveloper_2]: ‘The other side of the coin of humility is assertiveness, or force
    of character. A programmer’s job is to get things done, and getting
    things done sometimes requires moving around obstacles, jumping over
    them, or simply knocking them down. The humble person is acutely
    aware of the ways in which he may be wrong; his critical mind tends
    to dominate his force of character. Now, although it is true that
    force of character without a critical mind is like a safety valve
    without a steam boiler. There is no danger of explosion, but then
    there is no possibility of getting any work done, either.’ — Gerald
    Weinberg, *The Psychology of Computer Programming*

[^07thewebdeveloper_3]: ‘The job of system design calls for an eye which never loses sight
    of the forest, whereas the job of debugging may require that every
    tree—even every branch or left—be seen with utmost clarity. The job
    of coding often requires squeezing out every drop of redundancy, and
    the job of documentation may require that simple sentences be
    plumped up to a paragraph size.’ — Gerald Weinberg, *The Psychology
    of Computer Programming*
