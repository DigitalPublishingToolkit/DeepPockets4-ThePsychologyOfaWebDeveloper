# Scott Gives Me an Assignment

One day last year, I was sitting on a comfortable office chair in
Scottâ€™s studio, looking out the window after twenty minutes of staring
at a screen. The clouds over the tower cranes looked creamy; their image
absorbed my slippery thoughts. I was supposed to regain my focus,
prepare my ears for the assignment Scott was about to give me. Shifting
my gaze towards the tower cranes helpedâ€”their image reminded me that, at
this point in civilization, I will not live to see the day that these
clouds *arenâ€™t* accompanied by cranes.

Some sort of â€˜privateâ€™ social media platform was being built for the
students of a renowned academy overseas. The purpose of the platform was
to connect these students by allowing them to set up personal goals on
their accounts, follow classes, events, or other students, and to share
relevant media objects and references in their shared â€˜basketsâ€™. To
connect them even more, an option for the students to set up a specific
time zone was built. All data and information bits extracted from these
interactions were to be used solely for educational purposes.

As most of these functions were already built and working, the project
had reached a crucial phase in its development, which focused on user
participation and connectionâ€”a phase I call the â€˜psychological touchâ€™.

Scott was busy coding the invisible functions for online *what-if*
situations. The codeâ€™s logic behind most of the what-if situations is to
make something happen (clicking) in order to extract bits. The question
behind a what-if situation can be answered with at least three
solutions. For example:

What if the user doesnâ€™t have friends?

1. Remind them.
2. Propose to connect their friendsâ€™ list from another platform.
3. Suggest a friend.

What if the user doesnâ€™t go to an event?

1. Perhaps they could be interested in updates about said event?
2. You donâ€™t have to go but you can follow the event, which is part of a
series, so maybe you can go next time.
3. Are you sure?

What if the user doesnâ€™t react to the picture of a cat?

1. Here is a cuter cat.
2. How about a reduced amount of cat content?
3. But all your friends like it!

What if the user doesnâ€™t move the cursor?

1. Wait for seven seconds, then show a video of a cursor on steroids. The
longer the hovering, the bigger the cursor will grow.
2. Wait for seven seconds, then make the menu bounce.
3. Just let the ad appear with a big X button.

By answering these questions, the web developerâ€™s forever-aim is to make
the user *do* something and populate the website with information that
represents activity and traffic. Because most platforms are slightly
alienating at first, these situations usually occur at the beginning of
a platformâ€™s lifeâ€”before the platform gets populated with the usersâ€™
digital traces.

When the website gets busy due to the compliance of its users, the
responsibility of the what-if codes passes onto the users, who then
become the new psychological trigger for continuous user traffic. When
users see some of their friends liking a post, they will probably like
it too. In this case, the what-if code doesnâ€™t need to remind them that
they have the digital superpowers to like a post.

These are general examples from the worldwide web. Some streams are
relevant and some are absolutely irrelevant to the user who, by now, is
embedded on the platform enough to be able to sense the informationâ€™s
relevance, and who feels alarmed when information lacks the promise of
relevanceâ€™s continuity. In the case of an educational platform, things
get a bit trickier. Why would students *not* want to participate in
online activities their educator provides? I see this as an argument
Scott can easily win, for students want to score in the eyes of the
institution that supplies their online educational activities.

Winning this argument gives Scott eligibility to control how connected
he wants the users to be. â€˜Goodâ€™ web developers are expected to reduce
the duration of user alienation by making the users generate bits as
soon as they land on a platform. These class-A developers are deeply
aware of the detours the users can potentially follow on a platform, and
can guide these users into walking a â€˜straight lineâ€™ by coding their
behavior in advance.

Before giving me the assignment, Scott expressed how he wanted me to
code the actual functions for the platform, but also added, with a
smile, how Iâ€™m *just not there yet*. Until I gain eligibility (during my
free time after work, that is) letâ€™s just work with what we have, shall
we? Letâ€™s give this website a tone, for the English language is the one
understood by all.

Unsure whether I sensed his pride, or simply guilt for giving me work he
would rather not do himself, I directly followed Scottâ€™s instructions.
My task was to write sentences that point out the userâ€™s inactivity and
<s>trigger the user to generate data</s> motivate the user to share
references, go to events, connect, and contribute to the overall
knowledge production.

As a reaction to my excitement, Scott preached how user motivation could
only be achieved through a language that *avoids* literally describing
what the user isnâ€™t doing, but rather describes the consequences of
their inactivity on the platform.

I *rogerâ€™ed* that. I used it as a mantra throughout the whole working
day, which I spent writing a presentable version of the following list:

<center>There are no upcoming courses youâ€™re a follower of. (FACT)</center>

<center>You are not following any upcoming courses. (FACT)</center>

<center>Courses that you follow will be listed below. (SUGGESTIVE)</center>

It took a rather long time because I hated it, for similar reasons as to why I
hate Wordle.[^14scottgivesmeanassignment_2] While re-reading my written suggestions what bothered
me most was the impersonal tone behind them. Somehow, I couldnâ€™t make
them sound as if they were written by Scottâ€™s guts, or crafted by his
brain. Polite is hardâ€”I screamed long and hard inside my assigned,
linguistic trap, and I felt like a loser for not having a *natural*
sense for it.

But letâ€™s get one thing clear: within the web development scene, it
doesnâ€™t matter if politeness is a manner exercised in a web developerâ€™s
daily life. Itâ€™s a globally recognized strategy for building a platform.
If he doesnâ€™t make his product speak politely to the user in order to
get the so desired bits, the product is at risk of sounding either too
feminine or too authoritativeâ€”the two tones that, by 2022â€™s default,
carry the risk of the userâ€™s flight mode. Letâ€™s deconstruct these web
trends.

Feminine-sounding software doesnâ€™t shy away from using their technical
weak points as a digital marketing tool. Hereâ€™s an example of how they
intentionally sound vulnerable:

<center>Whoops ðŸ˜…. Please keep on patiently clicking the button until it works!</center>

At the other end of the spectrum, we see an authoritative tone in some
software that triggers fantasies of digital suicides, but never their
commitment:

<center>Itâ€™s someoneâ€™s birthday. Help them have a blast!

or

Are you aware that \[user name\]â€™s post was liked over 10 times already?</center>

One user, confronted with his inability to opt-out, texted me: *Fuck
Insta, but Iâ€™m still on it.* Fuck smartphones, but I still own one.

The neutral, polite tone of software protects it from sounding
differentâ€”sounding like too much of something. The factual tone of
politeness targets devotion of a user (who, if you recall, Iâ€™ve
introduced before) and who needs to be promised that, as a respected
client on the platform, their needs are constantly taken into account.
Even if theyâ€™re in fact not always met.

I need a small detour for a moment. In her book *All About Love*, bell
hooks writes about respect (through a dysfunctional, yet loving family)
in a way that resonates with my own reflections about how respect is
gained within any kind of relationship. As we know from lifeâ€™s lessons,
there are two possible intentions behind giving respect: the first one
is established through the genuine love and/or care for the other, and
the second one is constructed towards the demand for a specific amount
of reciprocal respect.

The first one, as hooks sees it, is given in the context of an intimate,
ongoing relationship between two partiesâ€”a parent, a friend, a friend
with benefits, a lover, spouse, collaborator. Their roles or titles are
established over time. In the case of the latterâ€”respect in return for
respectâ€”two parties donâ€™t necessarily *need* to get deeply involved or
spend any time with each other for them to *want* the desired benefit
from one another. Their roles or titles are set by default. They stay
together because of a mutual need for the bits, thus proving the
professionalization of their role/title: a web developer, a user,
seller, buyer. Quantification makes them stronger.

If I were to apply these same lessons regarding respect to web
development, Iâ€™d find it difficult to conclude that the web developerâ€™s
intention behind welcoming the user on their platform comes out of pure
*generosity* towards the user whose image, in the developerâ€™s eyes, is
shaped by the statistics generated from their compliance.

Please read:

<center>There are no baskets youâ€™re part of related to this course.</center>

The sentence suggests that the reason why Iâ€™m here (following the
courses I want, in order to be a good student) is inherently linked to
these baskets I know nothing about, but about which I apparently
*should* find out, such as why I need to carry them everywhere I go.
Wait: let me ask one of my few friends on this platform real quick.
Until I find out, let me just speculate. When I think of real-life
baskets, I think about whatâ€™s in themâ€¦ It might be that the digital ones
related to my courses are still empty? It might be that theyâ€™re filled
with a surprise, by default? Let me check. But, actually, if the
surprise is really in there, I might not even want it. Iâ€™d rather have
my friend drop one in there, but they havenâ€™t replied yet. Maybe theyâ€™re
following a lecture I wasnâ€™t updated about. Where are the events? Let me
seeâ€¦

This is how a platform gets populated and becomes a common user
reality.[^14scottgivesmeanassignment_3] Quickly. Seamlessly. Almost invisibly. Assuming that a
listening ear means being able to register everything that the user
opinionates about, and that this user needs to see the information bits
in order to feel heard, we see how â€˜politeâ€™ software entitles itself to
collect the user data and activity it needs in order to increase user
dependency. And because users build up important archives while
generating traffic, they soon become dependent on platforms that store
and organize their data for them. Naughty baskets!

This is not really news, so letâ€™s not dwell on these findings for too
long. What Iâ€™m more interested in, is looking at the impact of this user
dependency on polite software and the fashion of our conversations in
real life. (And in stating â€˜ourâ€™, I am in fact stating that weâ€™re *all*
users, including web developers.)

There are no baskets. There is one basket. There are two baskets. There
are three baskets. There are four baskets. There are five baskets. There
are six baskets. There are seven baskets.

(I think we get the point.)

While rating a product or confessing about romantic endeavors in a
chatroom here or there or everywhere, polite software awards the user
with facts that inform the user about what they just did:

You just left the group,

Thank you for your feedback,

OK,

Thanks,

OK, OK, thanks, thanks. OK, thanks, thanks.

Rate?

Itâ€™s exactly 21:00 PM.

Itâ€™s your bed time.

Itâ€™s a fact that you just left the group.

Itâ€™s true that you just left the group.

The user is continuously fed facts, and will pass these on to others (be
it software or a friend). Facts are known to compile together the system
of truth.[^14scottgivesmeanassignment_4] When polite software collects the extracts of truthâ€”all
the things the user talks about, rates, and reacts to wherever the user
is told to reactâ€”the logic behind its code becomes stronger and kills
any potential to behave against it. You cannot just *not* rate a
product, but you can give it less stars. Are you sure you want to close
the tab without sending that e-mail? This is what I call an extremely
organized user experience, a linear story. Like waking up, going to
work, and going to sleep. Everything works perfectly.

Understood as such, polite software becomes a product of not just
controlled language, but of the imagination that stretches this
vocabulary. A language that should be in continuous transformation,
molded by those who speak it, moving towards understanding each other,
is a language that is now a standard: one that says what should be
understood between the speakers, and how deep a discussion can really
go.[^14scottgivesmeanassignment_5]

Moving along with such a user experience can be compared to our
behaviours within urban landscapes. Isnâ€™t the point of going outside to
get from point A to point B? In Amsterdam more than in Mexico City, or
Sarajevo, for sure. Although Iâ€™m totally fine with not having a goal
while walking, Iâ€™ve seen a lot of my peers struggling to say yes to the
idea of an aimless stroll. Just like them, I feel users suffer from
feeling lost on platforms that *donâ€™t* extract bits from their
interactions. They simply donâ€™t how to move about without being part of
both the urban and software organization.

As for Scott and myself: I do not know what Scott wanted me to learn
that day. What I *did* learn is that politeness is not only a design
choice, but the rule by which a web developer chooses to live. When
isolated from the product and placed next to the hands that crafted it,
politeness becomes a shield that protects the acquired years-old
knowledge from intertwining with the emotional impulses (passion, anger,
desire...) that have the potential to cause its shattering. Because most
of the time is invested in maintaining a stable structure of knowledge,
these impulses are rushed, postponed, or even completely neglected. This
is the core behavior that builds up the stoic man: the logic of the
world robbing him of his boner.[^14scottgivesmeanassignment_6]

[^14scottgivesmeanassignment_2]: Its software design feels fun, at first. Guessing the word of the
    day right every single day of oneâ€™s life can make one excited about
    waking up. But it can also overwhelm oneâ€™s experience of daily life
    as it consumes good chunks of oneâ€™s morning time or, depending what
    kind of a player one is, the whole day. Donâ€™t play Wordle. Itâ€™s an
    attention sucking platform that makes you forget about the things
    youâ€™d rather do throughout the day and prioritize attaining the joy
    of beating your pals who scored just as good as you did. The worst
    part of it is that cheating feels terribly wrong. And that I still
    sometimes play it.

[^14scottgivesmeanassignment_3]: â€˜The scaling of the economy of gender features most prominently
    across discussions surrounding â€œbig data.â€™ For example, every
    forty-eight hours online we as a global community generate as much
    information as was generated in written history from the beginning
    of civilization until 2003.1) This data we generate triggers
    monumental questions about mass surveillance and how the information
    tied to our digital selves can be used to track our every movement.
    Our Internet search histories, social media habits, and modes of
    online communicationâ€”what sociologist David Lyon calls â€˜actual
    fragmentsâ€™â€”expose our innermost thoughts, anxieties, plans, desires,
    and goals. 2) Gender binary is a part of this engine: a body read
    online as male/female, masculine/feminine fulfills a target
    demographic for advertising and marketing. Google Ads explains
    gleefully to its users how â€˜with demographic targeting in Google
    Ads, you can reach a specific set of potential customers who are
    likely to be within a particular age range, gender, parental status,
    or household income. For instance, if you run a fitness studio
    exclusively for women, demographic targeting could help you avoid
    showing your ads to men.â€™ â€” Legacy Russell, *Glitch Feminism*

    produced, and pastoralists the land with which food is produced.
    Information circulated within working class culture as a social
