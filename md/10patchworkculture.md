# PATCHWORK CULTURE[^10patchworkculture_1]

There is no immateriality.

The brain does not oppose the body, it mirrors it.

The gaps are never empty, they’re neglected.

But also: ‘As we find solutions, we find even more ambitious
objectives.’[^10patchworkculture_2]

This time last year, while looking out of Studio Scott’s window, Larry
concludes that it’s definitely due to his compliant nature that his boss
chose *him* as an assistant. Enough time has passed for him to know that
Scott would never tolerate an aggressive web developer whose interest is
money and prestige, nor would he ever be able to tolerate a lone coding
wolf who’d rather be sniffing eagerly at alternative media spaces where
grids melt into transparent shapes, invisible to the naked eye. The reasons for choosing Larry are obvious: an aggressive type would be one too many in the studio, while a wolf could possibly threaten Scott’s own intellectual property.

After many years of being compliant to his boss, Larry finally has
started to feel uneasy. Reflecting on a mental image of himself in his
private life has confirmed that it’s a bit odd to be given such a
personality trait: ‘compliant nature.’ He shuffled through the last
three remaining images from his private life. Right there, he realized,
*that’s* the core of the problem: he never spends any time outside of
the studio. The last image shows a portrait of him, lounging on a sofa
on a Saturday night—exhausted; his tiredness blocking any further
development of a unique personality trait by which he could recognize
himself in an imaginary crowd.

But, he thought to himself, he’s an assistant web developer. It’s not
compliance that’s itching his skin, it’s his persistent staying power.
He didn’t stop coding since he learned how to code, didn’t even take one
day off. By now, he should be experienced enough to know that whatever
irritates him is only proof of his endurance. Instead of doubting, he
should feel proud.

*But really,* he asked himself, *how come he was never taught how to
look away from the screen, how to take a break?* The 20-20-20 rule
break, or lunch, or even holidays: they don’t count. Hmm. Larry
scratched himself slowly on the head. What does this mean?

He tried to imagine an authentic kind of break, but only bumped into the
limitations of his imagination. *Hmm.* As he continued cleaning the code
and scrolling down the client’s interface, he realized that all he’s
ever done is follow instructions on what to code and how to code it;
that his life has been a stage, designed by someone else’s set of time
frames. At this point, his sheer incompetence bursted into a diplomatic
rage. Although this rage was escalating sloooower than you might think,
it escalated further and further.

Hmm. Hmm. You know what’s funny? he thought to himself. In this
particular time frame, it’s enormously difficult to tell if his hands
are more expensive than his brain. As if … ‘As if how something is
assembled is alien to the impulse that created it.’ — Ocean Vuong, *On
Earth We*’*re Briefly Gorgeous*.

Imaginary sounds of laughter invaded the studio space. His body sent
three notifications: a cold shiver, a sudden wink of an eye, and a
knee-jerk.

Fuck it, Larry then decided out loud, and called it a day. He put his
computer to sleep, started scanning his physical surroundings. He looked
out of the window and saw pitch-black darkness. Envisioning the distance
it would take him to get home, it somehow felt really, *really* far
away. His body-brain-soul was not aligned. He felt nothing at all.

Before he leaves, he pulls his phone out of his pocket and reloads
Facebook on his browser. He had hoped to see red icons, messages,
events, invitations, or similar bits that would usually make him feel
like a local in town. Maybe, he thinks, he would like to get drunk. But
on his phone, only the silence caused by yesterday’s inactivity welcomes
him. Zero notifications, zero messages. Irony tickled him to smile and
say: *Look how far the interfaces have brought us.* Not far at all
indeed.

Instead of rushing home by bike, he decides to walk through the mental
blur that lives in his head tonight, walk it off. He wants to think. All
by himself. Just think. In the long run, he ponders, his commitment to
the machine and detachment from communal practices will be memorable to
no one, not even to himself. His memory will fade. It already has.
ZipSpace is the only website he remembers building by himself in the
last five years. But there were more. For sure there were more. Right?

He sinks a bit deeper. He should have remembered what Weinberg has
taught him about the pattern while reading his book all those centuries
ago; that was a good warning sign.[^10patchworkculture_3] He sinks even deeper. He
understands now that, although he is fueled by world-changing dreams
thrust upon him at the art academy, he cannot *actually* change the
world. He sinks deeper still. Countless web developers are on a similar
mission, and they’re probably technically more well-versed than he is.
Even deeper. If he *could* change the world, he’d turn it into a world
in which there are no problems, so that he would never have to fix them
again. He stops sinking. If he wants an interesting death, he’s going to have to work towards it. He starts swimming. If he wants emotional safety, he’s going to have to exterminate what makes his
environment unlovable. Larry reaches the surface, takes a deep breath.

*Fuck it*, he decides for the second time that day.

Fuck WordPress

Fuck SquareSpace

Fuck Cargo

Fuck WebFlow

Fuck Kirby

Fuck Sanity

Fuck StoryBlok

Fuck Content-full

Fuck Strapi

Ever heard of BlockSmith? A software to be produced by Larry’s own
brain.

This year, BlockSmith joined the tech market. Compared to Scott’s pretty
content management system, BlockSmith focuses on giving more freedom to
the users. It’s an online visual editor platform that allows coders and
non-coders to build a website. Subscription offers free templates
designed by Larry, but the content has to be provided by the users.

To better understand how BlockSmith works, just imagine if real life was
like web design. Imagine if things (like opening a door) just stopped
working (because there was no software update). Imagine if all people
were dressed the same (light-grey suits paired with Converse All Stars).
Imagine if things (like framed Matisse paintings) disappeared for no
apparent reason, or if things (like coffee) just wouldn’t go where you
wanted them to (into a mug). Imagine if you needed complicated tools
(like milk syringe) for the simplest tasks (to soak a cornflake).
Imagine if nothing (like sand) looks like it was supposed to (instead,
it resembles chocolate milk). Oh, yeah. Imagine if everything (like an IKEA-BEKANT working desk) simply broke down once it got too popular. What would you do, dear human?
That’s right. You’d never put up with it.

That’s why Larry built BlockSmith: so you can make things work exactly
the way they’re supposed to. Everything just *works* with BlockSmith—the
modern way to build structures for the web.

[^10patchworkculture_1]: ‘A patchwork culture of short-term memories and missing records,
    conflicting histories and discontinuous samples, strands of the
    narrative pulled out of time.’ — Sadie Plant, *Zeros and Ones*

[^10patchworkculture_2]: ‘If the supposed lack of such a central point was once to women’s
    detriment, it is now for those who thought themselves so soulful who
    are having to adjust to a reality in which there is no soul, no
    spirit, no mind, no central system of command in bodies and brains
    which are not, as a consequence, reduced to a soulless mechanistic
    device, but instead hum with complexities and speeds way beyond
    their own comprehension. This is not a brain opposed to the body.
    The brain is body, extending even to the fingertips, through all the
    thinking, pulsing, fluctuating chemistries, and virtually
    interconnected with the matters of other bodies, clothes, keyboards,
    traffic flows, city streets, data streams. There is no
    immateriality.’ — Sadie Plant, *Zeros and Ones*

[^10patchworkculture_3]: ‘Though details differ, the pattern is depressingly repetitive:
    Moving targets. Fluctuating goals. Unrealistic schedules. Missed
    deadlines. Ballooning costs. Despair. Chaos.’ — Gerald Weinberg,
    *The Psychology of Computer Programming*
